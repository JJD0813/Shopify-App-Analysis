# Shopify App Analysis Project

This project explores the landscape of apps available on the Shopify App Store, focusing on category trends, user engagement, and ratings. It was completed as part of a Power BI training module using a dataset of public statistics scraped from Shopify’s marketplace.

---

## 📊 The Data
The dataset includes four sheets:
- **apps**: General info on apps including ID, title, and developer
- **categories**: Lists app categories and how apps are grouped
- **reviews**: Includes ratings, dates, and review counts
- **app_categories**: Connects app IDs to multiple categories

---

## 📓 Part 1: App Landscape
In this section, I visualized the app ecosystem using the following:
- A **KPI Card** showing the total number of unique apps
- A **Column Chart** showing the number of apps per category
- A **Scatterplot** showing how many apps exist per category, sized by review count

Insights revealed top app categories with the highest variety and volume.

---

## 🖊️ Part 2: Reviews
To understand user satisfaction, I:
- Created a **new column** calculating weighted review impact using review count × average rating
- Built a **Bar Chart** to display total weighted rating impact per app
- Made a **KPI Card** with the average rating for all apps

These helped identify apps that had high impact and strong user sentiment.

## 👀 Part 3: App Reviews Deep Dive
This section focused on analyzing review trends:
- Created a line chart for **monthly reviews**
- Built a **Scatterplot** to compare number of reviews vs. average rating
- Identified standout apps with high rating and high engagement

Additional slicers were used to filter reviews by year and to isolate apps with more than 500 reviews.

## 🖼️ Project Screenshots
Due to GitHub's file size limits, the full `.pbix` file could not be uploaded. Instead, I've included high-resolution screenshots of the Power BI report visuals to showcase the analysis and dashboard design.  
You can find them in the project repository files for a visual walkthrough of each section.
